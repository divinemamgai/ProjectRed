# ProjectRed
A JavaScript based Game [Engine], under development.

Current Features :
1. Greedy algorithms for collision detection between circle and any closed polygon.
2. Physics processing which includes gravity, friction, and restitution. [Angular velocity depiction is not accurate yet, and accurate one doesn't look good either.]
3. JSON sprite input which allows maximum flexibility and easy stage creation.
4. Menu System with various text animations, mainly enter, emphasis and exit transitions.
5. And More...

Current Bugs Found :
1. High speed collision for complex polygons in specific cases is not working correctly. The solution I have might make the code more complex and less efficient, so debugging of this one is halted for now.
2. Let me know...

Current Limitations :
1. Collision detection limited to Circle With Polygons.
2. Single screen stage, i.e., no camera movement.
